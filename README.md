SIMPLE crop model from Zhao et al 2019

# SIMPLE Model

The SIMPLE model simulates crop growth, development, and yield using a daily time step. It accounts for the effects of daily temperature, heat stress, rainfall, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on crop growth. The model is designed to be simple and easy to use, with functions that have been employed in other models before.

## Features
- Simulates crop growth and development using daily time steps.
- Accounts for the effects of temperature, heat stress, drought stress, and CO2 concentration.
- Uses cumulative temperature to determine phenological development.
- Calculates daily biomass growth rate and cumulative biomass.
- Determines final yield based on cumulative biomass and harvest index.
